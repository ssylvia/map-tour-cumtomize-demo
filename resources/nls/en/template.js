					div20: "Supported pictures formats and videos",
					div21: "Supported picture format are: <b>.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif and .bmp</b>. If your media doesn’t end with that extension, the Map Tour will consider it to be a video, except when using a feature service (see below).",
					div22: "The Map Tour template doesn't include a video player, so you have to use the external video player provided by your favorite video hosting service (find the option to embed the video and copy the URL present in the given code). If you want to host the video yourself, you can create an HTML page that contains a video player like <a href='http://www.videojs.com/'>Video.js</a>.",
					div23: "The interactive builder doesn't provide a dialog to include video when using feature services with attachments, but it is possible to do so by editing your data outside of the interactive builder. In the arcgis.com map viewer, if you modify the picture fields to point to an external video and add a special parameter at the end of your URL (#isVideo), your media will be considered to be a video.",
					div24: "Note that you still need to have two valid pictures attachments or the point won’t be used. It isn't possible to use videos when using feature service attachments without the picture and thumbnail fields."

				tab3: {
					title: "Customization",
					div1: "The builder provides several customization options that are accessible through the SETTINGS button in the top panel. If you don't find the option you expect, we also provide a downloadable version that you can deploy on your web server and enhance to fit your needs.",
					div2: "We recommend that you use the hosted version unless:",
					div3: "<li>It doesn't offer a UI customization you want to have, like using a header background image.</li><li>You are a developer and you want to enhance the application.</li>",
					div4: "The downloadable version can be configured through a web map or a web mapping application identifier. The main use cases are:",
					div41: "You build your map tour using the interactive builder in the hosted environment and configure the template with the web mapping application identifier. The settings you have defined with the interactive builder will be applied.",
					div42: "You build your web map outside of the interactive builder and configure the template with the web map identifier. You will have to read the documentation to learn how to configure the template.",
					div43: "Note that the interactive builder is available in the downloadable version but with some technical restrictions on browsers like Internet Explorer older than version 10.",
					div5: "To download the most recent version of the template and learn more about how to use it, visit the <a href='https://github.com/Esri/map-tour-storytelling-template-js' target='_blank'>GitHub project page</a>."
				},
				tab4: {
					title: "Tips",
					div0: "Supported browsers",
					div0a: "The Map Tour viewer is supported on IE8+. The interactive builder is supported on IE9+. We actively test it in all major browsers but if you experience some difficulties, we recommend that you use Chrome.",
					div0b: "If you experience some difficulties, please let us know. In the meantime, by building your Map Tour using the CSV template you will minimize your interaction with the builder interface.",
					div1: "Pictures",
					div2: "We recommend landscape orientation photos instead of portrait orientation. Photos with a 4:3 aspect ratio fits best. Portrait orientation images can be used, but on smaller screens like the iPad a lot of the photo may be obscured by the caption (text takes up more space when it is displayed in a tall area compared to a wide area). Although images of different sizes, shapes, and orientation can be used in one Map Tour, we recommend using the exact same size and shape for all the images. In this way, the user won't be distracted by different sized images as they follow the tour.",
					div2a: "We recommend a maximum image size of 1000 pixels wide x 750 pixels tall for the main pictures and 140x93 for the thumbnails.",
					div3: "Formatting your caption text using HTML tags",
					div4: "The header and picture title/caption can include HTML tags to define formatting and links. For example, this code adds a yellow link:",
					div4a: "Write a good subtitle for your tour",
					div4b: "Take time to write a compelling subtitle for your tour. The subtitle is a good way to draw people into your tour and tell them what they will discover in it. It is also a good place to tell your audience the state or country that the tour is located in. For example don't assume that people know where the city or town in your tour is located. Your caption can also be formatted using HTML tags, such as including links. Don't make the caption too long though. In smaller browser windows or on the iPad it may not fit completely and be clipped. If you can't think of a good subtitle, leave it blank.",
					div5: "Supporting Layers",
					div6: "You can add additional supporting layers to provide context to the Map Tour. These layers may contain other geographic features you want the map to show in addition to the Map Tour points, such as a study area, a walking or driving route linking your tour points, etc. The Map Tour template displays these additional supporting layers using the symbology you specify in the web map, but the popups aren't available.",
					div7: "Keep your tour short and sweet",
					div8: "There's a limit of 99 points per tour. Most Map Tours will of course be significantly shorter than this. Don't expect your audience to want to step through too many tour points. You might find your subject fascinating, but don't assume they will, too!",
					div9: "To learn more, see <a href='https://github.com/Esri/map-tour-storytelling-template-js/raw/master/Readme.pdf' target='_blank'>the detailed guide</a>.",
					div10: "Embed mode",
					div11: "If you want to embed the template in another website through an iframe, adding the optional parameter \"&embed\" at the end of the URL will remove the header. That mode can also be set in the downloadable version through the configuration file.",
					div12: "Avoid using a narrow iFrame width that causes the map tour to switch to its responsive small screen touch-based layout. To maximize ease of use. When you embed a map tour, we always recommend still providing a link next to the embedded tour so that users can launch the tour full-screen."

				tab5: {
					title: "Publishing",
					div1: "When you are done, don't forget to share your Map Tour with your audience through the SHARE button or the application item page in ArcGIS Online.",
					div2a: "Sharing the Tour through the builder",
					div2b: "The SHARE button will update the application and webmap items. If your Tour data are stored in a Feature Service item, it will also be updated. If you have added others layers through ArcGIS.com map viewer, they won't be updated. This can result in the Tour not being shared as you expect. Items that already have the required (or more) privileges won't be updated.",
					div2c: "Sharing the Tour through ArcGIS Online",
					div2d: "When you share the application through ArcGIS Online, it will if necessary ask you to update any dependent resources (web map, feature service, decoration layer) that aren’t shared in the same way. If the Map Tour is public and one of your resources isn't shared with your audience, users will be redirected to the ArcGIS Online login page.",
					div3t: "Feature Service security",
					div3a: "If you are using a hosted feature service created through the Map Tour builder, the application manages the service security for you and you will remain the only one with editing privileges, even if you share the service publicly.",
					div3t2: "Before sharing your Tour with your audience",
					div3: "Make sure the Tour works well when you are not signed in with your ArcGIS.com account. The URL you are going to use should not redirect to a login page or to the builder mode.",
					div4: "It is a good idea to see what your map tour looks like on an iPad held in landscape orientation to make sure it looks good on this popular device. This can help you see if your captions cover up too much of the pictures. It also lets you see if your subtitle fits and isn't so long that it gets clipped.",
					div5a: "Recommendation for search",
					div5b: "To help people find your Map Tour if they search in ArcGIS Online, we recommend that you add the tag 'story map' into your map tour's application item page (not your web map's item page), along with tags such as the name of the state or province where the tour is located, the country name if it is outside the USA, and thematic tags like 'public art', 'tourist guide' or 'historic places'. These tags also help us at Esri to find cool new examples of tours we can showcase in our galleries and promote in social media. We also recommend that you upload a nice looking thumbnail graphic into your application item page, such as a small screenshot of the tour or one of the pictures from it. This picture is used automatically if your map tour is added into an ArcGIS Online gallery."
